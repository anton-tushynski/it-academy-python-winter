'''You are given an array with positive numbers and a number N. You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.
Input: Two arguments. An array as a list of integers and a number as a integer.

Output: The result as an integer.

Precondition: 0 < len(array) â‰¤ 10'''
